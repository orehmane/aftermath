Lucy had had a bad day.

She leaned back against the rock, panting slightly, and looked out across the
wasteland as the last pink-and-purple vestiges of dusk withered into night.
The normally immaculate white robes she wore for Sunday Mass were torn and
covered in dust, grime, and crusted blood from the numerous scrapes and cuts on
her aching body.  She groaned slightly as she adjusted to a more comfortable
position, and brushed auburn hair off of her pale, freckled forehead.

\textit{Ugh, what a disgusting feeling}, she thought as she ran her fingers
through her matted hair, greasy with dried sweat.  \textit{But at least I'm
alive.  For now.}

Lucy levered herself carefully to her right and leaned out, peering back
towards the city.  Spotlights glared fiercely into the sky, creating dancing
circles of light where they met clouds.  One beam briefly illuminated the
highest spire of the cathedral, which rose majestically even higher than the
city wall.  The cathedral she'd grown up in.  The cathedral she'd been inside
just this morning.

The cathedral she'd likely never enter again.

A sob came surging up to her throat, but Lucy forced it back down.  Time was of
the essence, and so her respite had to be cut short.  She struggled to her
feet.  Staggering for a moment, she walked on.

It is best to travel at night if one must travel in the wasteland.

Especially if one is being chased.
