It was a peaceful Sunday morning.  Lucy rose late and dressed leisurely, having
been assigned to the late morning Mass this Sunday, rather than the early
morning one she preferred.  Going without sleep made her feel abstinent, and
abstinence was, of course, holier.  Ah well.  As her custom was to fast until
she took Communion, she traded her abstinence from sleep for abstinence from
nourishment.  The Lord would accept either, she hoped.

She bathed with sweet-smelling soaps and dressed in a meticulously-pressed
robe.  Long and white with red and gold trim, the simple red cross on the chest
marked her as a journeyman of the Church.  Makeup did not befit an adherent,
but Lucy allowed herself a single concession to adornment and twisted her shiny
hair up into an elegant knot.

Lucy examined herself briefly in the mirror---satisfied that she was ready, she
placed a simple wooden cross on a strand of prayer beads around her neck,
tucked it into her habit, and exited her apartment, stepping into sandals that
had been laid out the night before.

It was a bright morning, so bright that Lucy was momentarily blinded as she
stepped out of her apartment onto the Cathedral's courtyard.  The sounds of
bustling streets filtered in over the outer wall---in addition to being the
seat of the Triumvirate, Neo Vatica was the Empire's premier commerical center,
and the Lord might have rested on the seventh day, but tradesmen did not share
that particular luxury.

Lucy walked slowly along the cobblestone path that ran like a spiderweb through
the immaculate lawn.  Two Paladins in full armor approached from the direction
of the main hall.

"Hello, Paladins!"  Lucy greeted them cheerily with a short wave.

"Hail, Adherent," replied one with a curt nod, the voice filter in his
full-face helmet flattening the humanity out of his voice. "\textit{Laudetur
Jesus Christus}."

"\textit{In saecula saeculorum, amen}," she replied as they parted, allowing
her to pass between them.
